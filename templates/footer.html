        <p>In this investigation, I found that from 2017 to 2021, walking (other than in Manhattan) and bicycling were very
             uncommon methods of commuting to work â€” with percentages being in the single digits
              across the boroughs. Also, I found that (excepting Staten Island), public
               transportation was the most widely used form of transportation for commuting to work and the use cars,
                vans, or trucks was less common.    </p>
